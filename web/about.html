    <h3>About Us!</h3>
    <br>
    We're the Winters Girls, just another plural system on the internet.
    <br>
    We're also transfem too! (she/they works for the entire system, anyone wondering)
    <br>
    We forgot how many alters exactly we have but even then the number is probably way higher
    <br>
    than the number we think we have. We're also autistic and shit, and to be quite honest probably
    <br>
    have our own chapter in the DSM. 
    <br>
    Our interests clearly stem from the old web and retro tech, we also are interested in 
    <br>
    aviation sometimes too!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br> 
    <h3>About This Site!</h3>
    <br>
    This site was made to be compatible with all the latest tech, specifically Windows 3.11, and
    <br>
    Mac OS 7. Packing all the latest and greatest HTML4 features, this is essentally the best way to
    <br>
    express ourselves to anyone with a fax modem. The site itself was actually built with VIM on Linux 
    <br>
    on a ThinkPad!
    <br>
    Like many others we wanted to have our own corner on the World Wide Web, and help work towards
    <br>
    a web that doesnt become shit, and instead becomes fun to surf, where each site is unique, and becomes
    <br>
    a place where friendships are made!
    <br>
    <br>
    The 'net is so fucking cool, human made sites where people express their interests and hobbies and 
    <br>
    they do it in the most passionate way possible to the point literal slide rules become something you
    <br>
    are dying to learn about cuz this one guy on the 'net is interested in them. Check out <a href="https://www.sliderule.ca/">www.sliderule.ca</a>,
    <br>
    you wont regret it.
    <br>
    <br>
    Think about it, in probably 30 years time computers will probably be creating peoples sites for
    <br>
    them. And instead of creativity its just computer generated bullshit. Dont let the 'net EVER become that
    <br>
    way.
    <br>
    <br>
    Feel free to dial up our site whenever and be sure to check the last edited date on our <a href="../index.html">Landing Page</a>.
    <br>
    If its recent, we probably added something since you last checked, its now your job to find what.
    <br>
    Sometimes we'll be messing with you and it was just a quick change in our HTML.

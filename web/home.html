    Hewwo! Welcome to our corner of the World Wide Web!
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    We're a system who do weird shit, if you want you can <a href="./about.html">learn more about us and this site.</a>

    <br>
    <br>
    We have a sidebar on the left for some quick hyperlinks to navigate our site,
    <br>
    for a full map of them you can visit our <a href="./indexpage.html">Site Index.</a>
    <br>
    <br>
    We made this site to specifically be compatible with NCSA Mosaic and Netscape Navigator.
    <br>
    However if you have a computer running Windows 3.11 or System 7 (otherwise known as Mac OS 7), 
    <br>
    a fax modem, a phone line, and a service to connect to the World Wide Web,
    <br>
    like America Online (ew...), this site will work fine!
    <br> 
    <br>
    If you are having issues with our site, please check the following:
    <br>
    Are you able to connect to another site? Are you certainly able to dial your service provider?
    <br>
    Are you an alien from the future? Is this America Online playing up again?
    <br>
    If you are sure this has nothing to do with any of those things, please <a href="./contact.html">contact us!</a>
    <br>
    Also for some reason NCSA Mosaic does not want to work with this site for whatever reason.
    <br>
    <br>
    Please also <a href="./contact.html">contact us</a> if you would like your 88x31 button to be featured in our <a href="../index.html">Landing Page!</a> 
    <br>
    Unfortunately requests may take a while as we are working on other projects, and college work too.
    <br>
    We plan to make our own 88x31 button soon too, which you can include in your site
    <br>
    once its complete. Please have it link to our <a href="../index.html">Landing Page</a> if possible, and certainly 
    <br> 
    let us know about it!

    The Winters Girls Frequently Asked Questions
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Q: Why does your site look weird on NCSA Mosaic?</h3>
    <br>
    A: Yeah Mosaic is fucked, we recommend using Netscape Navigator or another browser.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Q: Who is in your site icon?</h3>
    <br>
    A: From left to right, that is me (Ellie), the host of our system, and Autumn, one of
    <br> 
    our alters, who was actually the systems host right before I was a couple of years ago.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Q: Who runs this site?</h3>
    <br>
    A: Just me and my alters. One human body, one physical brain, many beings working on this
    <br>
    one site. Except for Lilliana, after her handling one of our other projects she isnt allowed
    <br>
    to touch this one.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Q: What was used to write this site?</h3>
    <br>
    A: If you havent noticed from one of our 88x31 buttons on the <a href="../index.html">Landing Page,</a>
    <br>
    this site was written in VIM. To be more specific, VIM on Linux on a ThinkPad.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Q: Can I link to this site?</h3>
    <br>
    A: Sure, no need to ask.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Q: When will your 88x31 button be done? Can I use it?</h3>
    <br>
    A: Whenever college stops treating us like shit. And yes once its done feel free to use it.
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>Q: Favourite aircraft?</h3>
    <br>
    A: McDonnell Douglas MD-11. Personally I love the one from the <a href="https://theoldnet.com/get?decode=false&scripts=false&timestamp=19970125082547&url=http://www.swissair.com/web/fleet.html">Swissair fleet.</a>
